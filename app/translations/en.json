	"app.components.AboutUs.description": "For our founder, his ambition was to transform the food industry in the middle east which meant enabling people to order the food they want, when they want it, so they could enjoy their perfect meal from the convenience of their homes or offices.\n\nIn 2012, in Khobar, the story was made live in the form of HungerStation, a website which has opened people’s doors and mouths to more dishes than they could ever ask for.\n\nToday, also in the form of an app, our company is a multi-city online food ordering and delivery system with over 4,000 restaurant partners, including internationally established brands and local cuisine.\n\nLooking ahead we want our user base to keep on growing as we keep giving consumers endless options in the most efficient way.",
